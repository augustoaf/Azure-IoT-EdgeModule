infra
------

-create iot hub
-create DPS
-create group enroll
-set DPS info on Device 2 

edge - part1 - downstream device
--------------------------------

-create vm with iot edge runtime
-create IoT edge device
-make a backup of the /etc/iotedge/config.yaml
-set iot edge device string connection + hostname (equals to VM public ip or dns name) on vm and restart iotedge runtime
-on iot edge device, set modules and confirm (just to have iot hub running, does not need to specify any module or configuration)
-check if edge modules are running and the device is connected to the iot hub
-create downstream device and provide the parent as the iot edge device
-set the downstream device string connection on the simulated device (Device 1) and add at the end the GW info ";GatewayHostName=<VM public ip or dns name>"
-allow vm edge gateway to receive connection through amqp/mqtt ports (5671, 8883)
-install certificates on Edge Gateway Device ...
start from step 10: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/set-up-iot-edge-gateway/4-generate-configure-iot-edge-device-certificates
-... and on downstream device as well

other reference: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/how-to-connect-downstream-device?view=iotedge-2018-06
-start downstream device.
-check if all is running

edge - part 2 - prepare the docker image and registry it in a docker registry service
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
zip the CalcModule project folder and send to the Edge Gateway (VM in Cloud)
unpack the CalcModule and get inside the folder to run the docker container and registry commands:
run this to generate the docker image: sudo docker build -f Dockerfile.amd64 -t augustoaf/edgecalcmodule:7.0 .
run this to login in your docker hub (registry service): docker login
run this to publish the image in the docker hub registry: docker push augustoaf/edgecalcmodule:7.0

edge - part 3 - install module and route downstream to it
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
install module on the edge using this uri: "docker.io/augustoaf/edgecalcmodule:7.0" .. use the module name as "CalcModule"
set the routes as below:
"CalcModuleToIoTHub": FROM /messages/modules/CalcModule/outputs/* INTO $upstream
"LeafDeviceToCalcModule": FROM /messages/* WHERE NOT IS_DEFINED($connectionModuleId) INTO BrokeredEndpoint("/modules/CalcModule/inputs/input1")

Final
--------
start device1 (downstream device - D2C messages through edget gw) and device2 (device - D2C messages directly through iot hub)
check messages delivered

route to event hub
------------------
create a routing rule on iot hub and point to an event hub instance all messages from edge device gateway. use the property added in the CalcModule (route query = "source = "edgeGateway"")
at event hub instance, create a shared access policy (mark listen) and use the string connection of this policy in your backend app
start backendapp + start monitoring of messages in iot hub

Additional items:
----------------------
there is an email alert for wrong direct methods


TROUBLE SHOOTING
------------------
edge module must establish communication with same procotol as leaf device. why(?)
